## INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT
Our car rental service allows for users to see all the cars which are available, which is also sorted by the make of the cars themselves, plus clients can see which cars are reserved for other clients and which are away from the depot
The system is made via command line interface, although it is very simple to use by any user, experienced or not
The users have to make an account where they can add funds to their balance, this will allow users to achieve discounts if they are a loyal client. Otherwise users can just pay directly via card.
In the car selection screen, the users type which make they want from the shown list of available vehicle makes, and then they are presented with all available vehicles for hire, with hourly price shown by the side of them
Users have preset selections of the duration of the hire, for example, half a day, a day, a week, a month etc. Although if they require a custom duration, this will incur additional fees
If they are missing the required funding, they will of course be unable to hire the selected vehicle, they will then be offered to either pay directly by card, or add funds to their balance, we also offer a private credit system, which will then in the long term increase their standing in the loyalty program
The system will automatically work out the total sum that is needed to be payed by the client
The account creation process is also simple, the user requires to add their email adress and make a password for their account, the system also doesnt allow invalid email addresses, plus they cant leave the password field empty. After creating the account, they can then log in using their account details to continue to the car rental homepage
